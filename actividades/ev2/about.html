                <h1>A little about myself...</h1>
                <p>I am currently in my third year of studying Software Development Engineering, with plans to graduate within the next year. My professional journey began outside of tech, working as a customer service representative in a call center for a year. I then transitioned into a quality data analyst role at an international automotive company. Although this job doesn't involve direct coding, I enjoy working with data and it has given me valuable insights into data management and reporting on a large scale.</p>
                <p>My interest in big data, databases, and artificial intelligence emerged through courses such as Big Data Fundamentals and Databases. In these classes, I worked with tools like MySQL Workbench, MongoDB, Power BI, and Azure, which fueled my passion for these fields. Currently, I’m enhancing my skills in web design and programming through courses like Interactive Design Production and Websites and Multimedia Programming, where I’ve worked with HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p>Outside of work and studies, I'm passionate about table tennis. I've been playing since I was 15 and currently represent my college team in tournaments. I also base my life and decisions on my Christian faith, which is central to who I am. At home, I have two pets a basset hound, Max, and an adopted cat, Leo. My favorite color is dark blue, and I love french fries.</p>
